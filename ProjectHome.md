Baze is a database development environment similar to Access and Base but for more advanced users. It allows you to connect to a number of different DBMS' including PostgreSQL, SQLite (relational databases), as well as NoSQL databases like XSB (deductive databases), eXist, CouchDB (semi-structured databases), ZODB (object-oriented databases) and Flora-2 (object-oriented deductive databases) and create database objects, queries and even user interface forms and scripts. The objects and connection settings are stored in a simple file which can be used from a number of end-point programming languages.
