The Baze is a database development environment similar to MS Access, 
LibreOffice Base, Query Anaylzer and similar. It supports a number
of SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, ODBC; eXist DB, XSB,
Flora-2, DES, ZODB) and support for other systems is pending.

It supports a number of query languages (SQL, Datalog, Py-MapReduce,
xPath, xQuery, transactional frame logic) and implements an experimental
scripting interface in Python, NodeJS and the R language. 

Creation of user designed forms is partially supported (experimental)
and support for report creation is pending.

It is implemented in Gambas3, not fully functional yet, but a lot
of functionality is already implemented. It uses the Datalog Educational
System (DES - see des.sourceforge.net) to supply Datalog queries for 
all types of relational databases that are supported.
