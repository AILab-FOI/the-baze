% Trying to assert a concept of incorrect arity:
/assert concepts(concept,neck,1)
% Trying to assert a concept of incorrect type:
/assert concepts(concepto,neck,0)
% Trying to assert a binary relation relating an unknown concept:
/assert binary_relation(part_of, neck, head)  
% Trying to assert an unknown binary relation:
/assert binary_relation(smaller_than, hand, arm) 
% Inserting an incorrect relation instance (part_of is asymmetric, so if finger is part of arm, the other way round is invalid):
/assert binary_relation(part_of, arm, finger)
% Redundant assertions due to implicit derivations:
redundant(R, X, Y)     
% Trying to assert an incorrect binary relation (a concept cannot be part or more than one other concept, excepting fingers):
/assert binary_relation(part_of, toe, arm)
