The Baze is a database development environment similar to MS Access, 
LibreOffice Base, Query Anaylzer and similar. It supports a number
of SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite; eXist DB, XSB,
Flora-2, ZODB) and support for other systems is pending.

It is implemented in Gambas3, not fully functional yet, but a lot
of functionality is already implemented. You can download the most
recent binary from:
